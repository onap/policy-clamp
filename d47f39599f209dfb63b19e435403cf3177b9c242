      "message": "It would be best to standardize on pattern lines as we do in core components.  Not sure if setting colors may run correctly in all cases.   I think it is preferable to be conservative in the files that are deployed, as they can be always be overriden if the user desires it.",

      "message": "I think this is toobroad on debug mode for this top level package as it captures many subpackages, etc .. I think, may be remove?  I am of the opinion of that default log level should be info max, they should be overwritable in a deployment with the logback.xml override that you have in the previous file .sh.   In addition, you could have added to the configuration element on top a watcher to detect log level changes in the file, so will do it automatically if changed, see for example logback.xml in core components, pap, etc .. for an example.",
