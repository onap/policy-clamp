      "message": "In theory, the springfox-boot-starter library (line 39) pulls transitively versions of older swagger-models versions (1.5.X) so this may not be needed if you are not using policy-endpoints or other base, that pulls the 1.6.x versions pulled in by other libraries ie. policy-endpoints.   I discovered that recently as in the case of drools-apps, the 1.5.x swagger-modesl are picked up transitively into the classpath and were in conflict with 1.6.x swagger libraries from policy-common breaking the telemetry api in honolulu and master.  FYI, as here you may end up in classpath with similar configuration with this library, conflicting with the one pulled in in an older version from line 139.",

      "message": "I dug into this for the last few hours. It seems that Swagger has changed its group name from \"io.swagger\" to \"io.swagger.core.v3\". 1.6.2 is the last version of the \"io.swagger\" group but \"2.1.10\" is the latest version of the \"io.swagger.core.v3\" group.\n\nFor example 1.6.2 See:\nhttps://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.swagger/swagger-annotations\nand:\n2.1.10 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.swagger.core.v3/swagger-annotations\n\nNow, the Swagger dependencies are used in common and models as well as CLAMP. I will upgrade swagger for all the components in subsequent reviews.\n\nHowever, this issue is blocking us in CLAMP, we can\u0027t get our builds and tests to work without this change so would it be OK to merge this change to bring everything up to 1.6.2 and I\u0027ll upgrade the swagger on everything in later reviews?",
