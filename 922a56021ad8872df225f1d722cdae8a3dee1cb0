      "message": "for now, let\u0027s change it to mirror what is done in the other policy repos.\n\nNevertheless, this raises a good point: many of these config files found in the various policy repos will not work as is in either CSITs or on Wind River.  As such, they\u0027re really just examples.  Question: should these be changed so they work out of the box in one of those environments, or possibly in a \"stand-alone\" environment?  Or should we move them to an \"examples\" folder and thus exclude them from the release artifacts?  I\u0027m of leaning toward the latter, even though it means that anyone wanting to the component would always have to provide an appropriate config file for their environment.\n\nOther opinions?",

      "message": "Yeah - thinking about this more. I know the other repos have these also most likely in src/main/resources. We can do the same as them. But are they needed? Possibly for a development environment - but then again if its configurable all you have to do is be able to set an environment variable or command line to point to a test file. The thing is, the user/password just happens to be the same that we use in OOM by default. I understand that can be changed but we really should have been more careful.\n\nOthers?",

But later, when we changed it to use the common simulator name service \"policy.api.simpledemo.onap.org\", this required us to mount the config file too with just this name change. \nEven in OOM, we have a copy of the config file, but the only change there is the username/password env variables usage.\n\nI am okay with removal if necessary, but I think it is good to have a default config file with all the standard service names with which the container can just start up with and start communicating with services in a standard setup by default",

      "message": "I can modify the CSITs to use message-router, instead.  However, they would still need to mount their own config files, as we use https in the CSITs, while we\u0027ve chosen to use plain http in the config files that come with the repos.  (In addition, the PAP repo includes policy-distribution in the health check, but I didn\u0027t want the PAP CSIT to depend on distribution, so it requires a config override anyway.)\n\nBTW: OOM should enable https, too.  If it doesn\u0027t, that\u0027s a bug.  If we were OK changing the repos to use https, instead, then we could remove most of the overrides in the CSITs.  (You can always use the gen_keystore.sh script in the CSITs to generate a certificate for use in other environments.)\n\nFor now, I think the latest file (i.e., containing \"message-router\") is good, but wouldn\u0027t mind continuing this discussion.",
