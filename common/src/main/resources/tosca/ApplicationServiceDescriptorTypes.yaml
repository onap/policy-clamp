        description: Describes external interface(s) exposed by this AS enabling connection with a VL.
                     (Similar to VnfExtCpd on VNF-D, but only describing L3 and above interfaces, since
                     K8S canâ€™t do <L3)
      enhancedClusterCapabilities:
        type: string
        required: false
        description: Describes expected capabilities of the target Kubernetes cluster to aid placement of the
                     application service on a suitable cluster. Examples of capabilities are; required networking
                     characteristics, Kubernetes API extensions or quantifiable node specific resources. This attribute
                     can contain information complementing information provided in the referenced DeploymentArtifacts.
                     Note; Modeling of enhancedClusterCapabilities is subject to standardization but is ffs. Alignment
                     between O2-IMS and O2-DMS of these values is required.
