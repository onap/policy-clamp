      "message": "Jim, I fully agree with the principle nothing to say against it. Usually there is not much framework to test the exception itself, it\u0027s usually the usage of the exception that is tested.\nThe proof i guess is that you had to write something for that in the PEF code, i\u0027m not aware of any library to do that ?\n\nAnyway let me check your ExceptionsTester class, I guess it will increase a little our coverage so it\u0027s always good to take ðŸ˜Š",
