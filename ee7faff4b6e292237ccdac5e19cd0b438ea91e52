These configurations would be changed during deployment - these configs would have to be changed depending on where ONAP is deployed. See Seb\u0027s comment from earlier on the same line: \"It\u0027s ok to keep localhost, those are typically replaced in OOM by the right values.\". I can still change if you feel it is necessary Ajith?",
